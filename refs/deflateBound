 * For the default windowBits of 15 and memLevel of 8, this function returns
 * a close to exact, as well as small, upper bound on the compressed size.
 * They are coded as constants here for a reason--if the #define&apos;s are
 * changed, then this function needs to be changed as well.  The return
 * value for 15 and 8 only works for those exact settings.
 *
 * For any setting other than those defaults for windowBits and memLevel,
 * the value returned is a conservative worst case for the maximum expansion
 * resulting from using fixed blocks instead of stored blocks, which deflate
 * can emit on compressed data for some combinations of the parameters.
 *
 * This function could be more sophisticated to provide closer upper bounds for
 * every combination of windowBits and memLevel.  But even the conservative
 * upper bound of about 14% expansion does not seem onerous for output buffer
 * allocation.
