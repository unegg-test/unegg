       *  This function erases an element, pointed to by the given iterator,
       *  from a %set.  Note that this function only erases the element, and
       *  that if the element is itself a pointer, the pointed-to memory is not
       *  touched in any way.  Managing the pointer is the user&apos;s
       *  responsibility.
