       *  @brief Attempts to insert an element into the %set.
       *  @param  __x  Element to be inserted.
       *  @return  A pair, of which the first element is an iterator that points
       *           to the possibly inserted element, and the second is a bool
       *           that is true if the element was actually inserted.
       *
       *  This function attempts to insert an element into the %set.  A %set
       *  relies on unique keys and thus an element is only inserted if it is
       *  not already present in the %set.
       *
       *  Insertion requires logarithmic time.
