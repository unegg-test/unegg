   inflate() uses a state machine to process as much input data and generate as
   much output data as possible before returning.  The state machine is
   structured roughly as follows:

    for (;;) switch (state) {
    ...
    case STATEn:
        if (not enough input data or output space to make progress)
            return;
        ... make progress ...
        state = STATEm;
        break;
    ...
    }

   so when inflate() is called again, the same case is attempted again, and
   if the appropriate resources are provided, the machine proceeds to the
   next state.  The NEEDBITS() macro is usually the way the state evaluates
   whether it can proceed or should return.  NEEDBITS() does the return if
   the requested bits are not available.  The typical use of the BITS macros
   is:

        NEEDBITS(n);
        ... do something with BITS(n) ...
        DROPBITS(n);

   where NEEDBITS(n) either returns from inflate() if there isn&apos;t enough
   input left to load n bits into the accumulator, or it continues.  BITS(n)
   gives the low n bits in the accumulator.  When done, DROPBITS(n) drops
   the low n bits off the accumulator.  INITBITS() clears the accumulator
   and sets the number of available bits to zero.  BYTEBITS() discards just
   enough bits to put the accumulator on a byte boundary.  After BYTEBITS()
   and a NEEDBITS(8), then BITS(8) would return the next byte in the stream.

   NEEDBITS(n) uses PULLBYTE() to get an available byte of input, or to return
   if there is no input available.  The decoding of variable length codes uses
   PULLBYTE() directly in order to pull just enough bytes to decode the next
   code, and no more.

   Some states loop until they get enough input, making sure that enough
   state information is maintained to continue the loop where it left off
   if NEEDBITS() returns in the loop.  For example, want, need, and keep
   would all have to actually be part of the saved state in case NEEDBITS()
   returns:

    case STATEw:
        while (want &lt; need) {
            NEEDBITS(n);
            keep[want++] = BITS(n);
            DROPBITS(n);
        }
        state = STATEx;
    case STATEx:

   As shown above, if the next state is also the next case, then the break
   is omitted.

   A state may also return if there is not enough output space available to
   complete that state.  Those states are copying stored data, writing a
   literal byte, and copying a matching string.

   When returning, a &quot;goto inf_leave&quot; is used to update the total counters,
   update the check value, and determine whether any progress has been made
   during that inflate() call in order to return the proper return code.
   Progress is defined as a change in either strm-&gt;avail_in or strm-&gt;avail_out.
   When there is a window, goto inf_leave will update the window with the last
   output written.  If a goto inf_leave occurs in the middle of decompression
   and there is no window currently, goto inf_leave will create one and copy
   output to the window for the next call of inflate().

   In this implementation, the flush parameter of inflate() only affects the
   return code (per zlib.h).  inflate() always writes as much as possible to
   strm-&gt;next_out, given the space available and the provided input--the effect
   documented in zlib.h of Z_SYNC_FLUSH.  Furthermore, inflate() always defers
   the allocation of and copying into a sliding window until necessary, which
   provides the effect documented in zlib.h for Z_FINISH when the entire input
   stream available.  So the only thing the flush parameter actually does is:
   when flush is set to Z_FINISH, inflate() cannot return Z_OK.  Instead it
   will return Z_BUF_ERROR if it has not reached the end of the stream.
