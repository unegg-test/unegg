       *  @brief  Attempt to preallocate enough memory for specified number of
       *          elements.
       *  @param  __n  Number of elements required.
       *  @throw  std::length_error  If @a n exceeds @c max_size().
       *
       *  This function attempts to reserve enough memory for the
       *  %vector to hold the specified number of elements.  If the
       *  number requested is more than max_size(), length_error is
       *  thrown.
       *
       *  The advantage of this function is that if optimal code is a
       *  necessity and the user can determine the number of elements
       *  that will be required, the user can reserve the memory in
       *  %advance, and thus prevent a possible reallocation of memory
       *  and copying of %vector data.
